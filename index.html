            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! My name is Sharlene, but most people know me as Shasha. I was born in the beautiful
                Philippines, where I still live with my family. I'm 20 years old and full of dreams, energy, and
                curiosity. I absolutely love spending time with my friends, especially through online games where we can
                connect, strategize, and have endless fun together, no matter where we are in the world.

                Since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by technology, and my dream is to one day become a game
                developer, creating immersive worlds and exciting experiences for others to enjoy. But as I dive deeper
                into the world of tech, I’ve found myself incredibly interested in artificial intelligence as well.
                There’s just something magical about exploring how AI can help make life better, smarter, and more
                creative.

                I’m a lifelong learner who believes that every day is a new opportunity to grow, explore, and challenge
                myself. I love taking on new projects, learning new skills, and dreaming up big ideas for the future.
                With every challenge I face, I remind myself that passion and persistence can take me anywhere I want to
                go. Here’s to a future full of learning, growth, and the excitement of discovering what’s possible!</p>
